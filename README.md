## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about responsive design and combine colors in css to 
create a great combination

This is some of the HTML code that i'm proud of:

```html
<div class="flex-container">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="img-container-equilibrium">
                <img src="img/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="" class="img-equilibrium">
                <div class="img-active"></div>
                <div class="view-icon-container">
                    <svg class="view-icon" width="48" height="48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M0 0h48v48H0z"/><path d="M24 9C14 9 5.46 15.22 2 24c3.46 8.78 12 15 22 15 10.01 0 18.54-6.22 22-15-3.46-8.78-11.99-15-22-15Zm0 25c-5.52 0-10-4.48-10-10s4.48-10 10-10 10 4.48 10 10-4.48 10-10 10Zm0-16c-3.31 0-6 2.69-6 6s2.69 6 6 6 6-2.69 6-6-2.69-6-6-6Z" fill="#FFF" fill-rule="nonzero"/></g></svg>
                </div>
            </div>
</div>
```
Some of the css code that i'm proud of (flexbox is very helpful
in this situations):

```css
.flex-container{
    display: flex;
    width: 100%;
    height: 615px;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: 60px 0;
}

.card{
    background-color: #14253D;
    border-radius: 15px;
    width: 330px;
    height: 565px;
    box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.56) 0px 22px 70px 4px;
    
}
```
